# Pixel Link using a Mobilenet feature detector

This repository contains a modified version of the [PixelLink](https://github.com/ZJULearning/pixel_link) text detector that uses a Mobilenet v2 feature detector, rather than the original VGG detector used in the original version. Please see the original repository for details on how to train and test your own models.


The advantage of Mobilenet over ResNet is a substantial reduction in model size for a relatively small drop in accuracy.
